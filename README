NAME
    Padre::Plugin::Pip - A Padre plugin for the pip installer tool

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides relatively simple GUI access to the pip command
    line installation tool.

    After installation there should be a menu items *Padre - Plugins - Pip -
    Install Distribution File* and *Padre - Plugins - Pip - Install
    Distribution URI*.

    As the distribution installs, the output will be spooled to the output
    window.

TO DO
    Add variants that use a file selector, and that sniff the Clipboard for
    a URL to install.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker, located at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Padre-Plugin-Pip>

    For general comments, contact the author.
